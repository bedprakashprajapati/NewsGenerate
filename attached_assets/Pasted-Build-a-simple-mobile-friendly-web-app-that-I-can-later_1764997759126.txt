Build a simple mobile-friendly web app that I can later deploy and use like an app on my phone. The core purpose is to generate a tweet-sized news post (maximum 270 characters) plus a related image, based on live news scraped from specific news channels.

Core requirements
Start by designing a clean, minimal home screen with a grid or list of news source buttons. Examples of sources:

BBC

BBC India

Times of India

Aaj Tak

ANI

CNN

NDTV

India Today

ABP News

Al Jazeera

Make it easy to add or remove sources later in code.

When I tap/click one source, open a second screen/interface dedicated to that source. On this screen, show buttons for news categories:

“Generate New” (or “Random Latest”)

“Top News”

“Politics News”

“Sports News”

“Tech News”

“International News”

When I click any category button:

Scrape the latest relevant news article from that specific source and category.

From that article, extract:

Headline

Short description or first paragraph

A thumbnail or main image URL that clearly matches that article.

Generate tweet text:

Create a tweet-style text summary of that article.

Hard limit: max 270 characters, including hashtags if you add them.

The text should be clear, readable English, and must accurately reflect the article content.

Do not hallucinate facts; base the summary only on the scraped content.

Display the result:

Show:

The generated tweet text in a text box.

The related image (loaded from the scraped image URL) below or beside the text.

Add a “Copy Tweet” button that copies only the tweet text to clipboard.

Add a “Copy Image URL” button (or “Download Image” if easy) so I can easily use the same image on Twitter/X.

Ensure the image you show is actually from that article and not a random image.

Technical details:

Use Python on the backend (Flask or FastAPI is fine).

For scraping, use BeautifulSoup + requests, or any robust, free method that reliably:

Gets the latest news.

Gets the correct image for the article.

Structure the scraping so that each news source and category has its own function or configuration, so I can add more sources later.

Handle basic errors gracefully:

If scraping fails or no image is found, show a clear error message and allow trying again.

Make the frontend simple HTML/CSS/JS that works well on mobile (responsive design, large buttons).

UX flow:

Home screen → choose news source

Source screen → choose category (Top, Politics, Sports, Tech, International, Generate New)

App fetches latest article for that source + category, generates tweet text (<270 chars), fetches related image, and displays both with copy buttons.

Code quality:

Comment the code clearly:

Where to change or add news sources.

Where to adjust categories.

Where the tweet length limit (270) is enforced.

Provide instructions at the end of the code or in a README-style block:

How to run this on Replit.

Which environment variables or config values I must set (if any).

How to open it in a browser and test.

Ensure the app can be used as a PWA or is at least mobile-friendly so I can “Add to Home Screen” on my phone later.

Produce the full backend and frontend code, plus any necessary setup instructions, so that I can copy-paste it into a Replit project and run it directly.
